LSR XML Helper - Included Files (DO NOT MOVE)

Important:
All files and folders included with this download must stay together.
You do NOT need to keep this specific folder name, but you MUST keep all of its contents together in the same place.

Do NOT delete files.
Do NOT move files/folders out of this set.
Do NOT rename folders or files.

Where these files should go:
You can copy ALL of these contents into your LSR XML Helper Root directory:

Grand Theft Auto V\Plugins\LosSantosRED\LSR-XML-Helper

The app will create and use this folder automatically AFTER you start the app and select your Los Santos Red Plugins folder (the folder where your XML files are located). Once you choose that folder, the app will generate the required helper folders (Backups, Shared Config Packs, Guides, etc.) inside:

Grand Theft Auto V\Plugins\LosSantosRED\LSR-XML-Helper

If you do copy it:
- Copy ALL contents (every file + every folder)
- Paste them into the root directory above
- Keep the structure exactly the same after copying
- Do not delete, move, or rename anything
